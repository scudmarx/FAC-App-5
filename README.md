 ## Game

 I want to make a game that has **characters** the player can **embody**, with **abilities** that the player can **choose**, in order to **overcome conflict**. I would like to have a **randomised** element of gameplay so that players can **learn** to overcome challenges that require different strategies.

 I will need to create **data** that the randomisation engine can draw upon, and **logic** to combine that data into components and process the interactions between those components and the player's inputs.

I will need to create a UI that displays:
- The current challenge and its particular requirements and current status.
- The abilities currently available to overcome that challenge.
- Feedback to the player on how their ability selections are interacting with the challenge to affect its status.
- Feedback on how successful players were at overcoming the challenge when it has concluded.
